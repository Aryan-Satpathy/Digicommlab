## Experiment 2 | Line Coding

This Experiment introduces Line Coding, which is a Channel Coding Technique. I couldn't build the AMI Circuit(thanks to broken breadboard!!) but the logic is solid. Just be sure to perform an AND operation on `sequence` with RZ(You will understand when you look at the Report). Other than that, there are no comments.
